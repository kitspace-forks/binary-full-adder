# Binary Full Adder
##An open hardware implementation of a binary full adder.

A simple collection of documents for beginners to electronics and PCB design to learn from. This was my first attempt to learn how to use EAGLE for my own projects. Information on the net is actually fairly sparse regarding adder-as-PCB implementations, so I thought I may as well fix that. There's a lot to learn from this simple schematic about gates, and how to bring your ideas to reality using CAD software.

Happy hacking.

## License Rationale
I selected the GPL v3 as opposed to an open hardware-specific license (e.g. CERN OHL), because I wanted the ease-of-use it brings, and to be as copyleft as possible. A binary full adder is a trivial schematic to implement, so I'm not all that worried this project will be used to earn piles of money or be perverted by Big Business TM to suit their nefarious needs.
